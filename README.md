<h3>How i can get the orbis_swu.self ?</h3>

You simply need to extract it with the FTP from your PS4. You can after just edit with IDA and a HEX Editor.

You need to make some patch for launch it on your PS4, for now, you need to call the syscall 67 at the begin of the process.
See here for orbis_swu (5.05):

![Start syscall patch 1](https://nsa40.casimages.com/img/2019/12/16/191216041055338701.png "Start syscall patch 1")

You're also need to patch the function sceVideoOutOpen for using the bus MAIN (set rdi [Arg 2] to 0).

![sceVideoOutOpen patch 2](https://nsa40.casimages.com/img/2019/12/16/191216041055427269.png "sceVideoOutOpen patch 2")

After, you need to fake sign it with the make_fself from [FlatZ](https://twitter.com/flat_z).
The AuthID for orbis_swu is : *010000000010003800000000001c004000ff00000000008000000000000000000000000000000000000000c000400040000000000000008000000000000000f00040ffff000000f000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000*
